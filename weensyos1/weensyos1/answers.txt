Response to Exercise 1:

Yes. The sys_getpid() call will return the correct value since the pid value
has been saved to the eax register. When schedule() runs and calls a different
process, context switching causes the data in the registers to be saved to
memory. When the system returns to this process later on, this data will be
restored to the registers and eax will contain the correct value.

Response to Exercise 2:

do_fork() and copy_stack() are implemented in mpos-kern.c

Response to Exercise 3:

Implementation of INT_SYS_WAIT and INT_SYS_EXIT is changed in mpos-kern.c to
use blocking instead of polling. If sys_wait is called on process 'A' by
process 'B'  and process 'A' is not ready to exit yet, process B's state will
be set to P_BLOCKED and process A will have a variable containing Process B's
PID. 

Once process B exits in INT_SYS_EXIT, process B will remove the block on
A and then return the exit status in Process B's eax.


Response to Exercise 4:

In INT_SYS_EXIT, the process sets the state to P_ZOMBIE when the state should
be P_EMPTY since the process is exiting. Changing this line fixes the problem
and the program runs correctly.
